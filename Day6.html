<h2 id="head2">MNC Companies in India</h2>
<p id="tech">All you need to know about multinational companies (MNC) in India, courtesy of 3E Accounting.

Multinational companies have a long tradition of doing business across the world. They are considered empire builders that extend a company’s reach globally. One of the first multinational companies (MNC) in India and the world was the East India Company. Established in 1600, it was used to ply the trade for Britain throughout its colonies.

As of 2020, India has more than forty thousand MNCs, with approximately a quarter-million affiliates overseas. MNCs are popular as India has one of the fastest-growing economies and a significant market population. The Government has also recently eased its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) regulations by allowing 100% foreign equity.

MNCs generate enormous revenue, employ hundreds of thousands, and contribute significantly to the economy. They are massive firms that originate from one country (the ‘home’ country) and set up businesses globally (the ‘host’ countries). An absolute majority of the Board of Directors and more than half the capital assets are from the home country.

Operations are usually set up in host countries that are still developing. Here, resources such as labour and materials are generally cheaper than in the home country. Developing countries will also have more flexible rules and regulations. In return, MNCs introduce modernization, contribute to infrastructure growth, stimulate the economy, provide employment, and reduce the technological gap.</p>
